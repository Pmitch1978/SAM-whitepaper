# SAM: Synthetic Authored Music

**Author: Patrick Mitchell**

This repository contains the official whitepaper for **SAM** — a creative framework for designing emotionally consistent, AI-assisted musical artists.

## 🔍 What is SAM?

SAM (Synthetic Authored Music) blends AI vocal synthesis, curated emotional identity, and forensic-grade mastering to create artists who sound—and feel—human.

This document outlines the theory, production process, and results of the first known synthetic artist to pass as real under forensic and listener analysis.
